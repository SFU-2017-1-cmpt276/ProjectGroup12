***Installation Process***
--------------------------

**Prerequisites:**

 - XCode 8.2
 - Swift 3

Ensure git is installed on your Mac computer. Then in terminal enter into the directory you wish to clone our project, and enter

    git clone https://github.com/SFU-2017-1-cmpt276/ProjectGroup12.git

After github has finished downloading the file, open the ProjectGroup12 file, then the AdventureSFU file. Due to the use of Cocoapods it is required you open the AdventureSFU.xcworkspace file, and ***not*** the AdventureSFU.xcodeproj file.
