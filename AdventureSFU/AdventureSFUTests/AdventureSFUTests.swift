//Test Case Note:	Currently our test cases, as provided in the Revised Quality Assurance Document, were not performed via XCode's Unit Test Software, but rather via running through
//					unit tests created specifically by the programmer at the time of development. The use of XCode's testing software is something our team is in the process of 
//					learning, but we were not yet at a stage with the tools to satisfactorily provide full test code coverage in a way that running through our own unit tests
//					individually could not better handle. We look into having simplified unit test cases available via XCode's testing tools for the final version of our software
